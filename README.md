# harha
A HAptic Robotic HAnd project.
The purpose of this project is to create a relatively low-cost robotic hand with pressure sensing. It will be able to perform both a fine grip (thumb and index finger) and a power grip (the whole hand).
The haptic sensing is done with piezoresistive material and printed electronics and is based on the zPatch project (https://github.com/zPatch/zPatch.github.io). Unlike zPatch, HARHA uses only the resistive measurement from the sensor, ignoring the capacitive one.
